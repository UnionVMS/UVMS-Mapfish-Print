Summary
-------
This repository is a submodule of mapfish-print and contains e2e tests for the pdf and image generation.  It contains the code to
start a Geoserver instance and run junit integration tests against the server to test as many of the mapfish-print options as possible.

To run the integration tests::

    ./gradlew examples:test

The task is a gradle test task and more details on how to run single tests or subgroups of tests can be understood by referring to:

    http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_test


Test client
------------

The test server includes a client which can be used for testing. To start the server, run::

     ./gradlew examples:jettyRun


This will start a GeoServer at localhost:9876 but also a MapFish Print with a simple client that can be accessed
at http://localhost:8080/print-servlet/


Writing Tests
-------------

By default the test server is in daemon mode, which mean that the servers will be run in a background thread and be shutdown when
the build completes.  In order to be able to run the tests in a IDE one can run::

     ./gradlew examples:jettyRun

This will start the test servers in non-daemon mode allowing one to start the server and then run tests in your IDE against that server for
development.
