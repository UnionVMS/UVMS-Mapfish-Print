<p>The purpose of Mapfish Print is to create reports that contain maps (and map related components) within them.
</p>
<p>
    The project is a Java based servlet/library/application based on the mature
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library" target="_blank">Jasper Reports Library</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Mapfish Print has the following distributions:
<ul>
    <li>
        The most commonly used distribution is the <em>war</em> distribution where Mapfish Print is a servlet and can be run in a
        servlet container like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mapfish Print is also distributed as a Java <em>jar</em> which allows Mapfish Print to be used like a normal Java library, or
        embedded in an existing Java web application as an addition servlet.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Java <em>war</em> is also packaged as a debian package.
    </li>
    <li>
        The last distribution is an command-line application where the reports can be generated via command line.  This is useful for
        debugging configurations and requests.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>The (much simplified) architecture of Mapfish Print is as follows:
</p>

<img class="architecture" src="images/Mapfish_Print_V3_Architecture.svg" />

<p>This diagram illustrates how a client (web-client or Java application) communicates with the Mapfish Print Server.  In the case of a Java application
the communication is directly with the Java Servlet Object and for web-clients via HTTP requests.  The protocol consists of several requests, only a few of which are shown in the diagram.  For the full list of requests see:
<a href="api.html">Web Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>The typical request sequence a client will make is as follows:
<ul>
    <li>
        If the client is a generic client, the client will make a capabilities request in order to obtain information about the required <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> needed to be sent to the server.
    </li>
    <li>
        Next the create request will be made and all the <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> (the data required in order to print the report) are sent to the server.  The server will return a reference id of the print job for obtaining the report and the status.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the create request returns, the client will poll the server asking about the status of the print.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the status request returns the completion response (and not an error) then the client will make the GET report request.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    On the server side, once a create request is received the server will create a print job and send it to the job manager, which is
    responsible for running the print job asynchronously (possibly on a completely different server) and allowing the HTTP request to
    return a response to the user without waiting for the print job to complete. As an aside, there is a <code>createAndGet</code> request that will
    wait until the printing is done and directly return the report without having to poll to see if the print is done. This is a
    convenience for client makers.
</p>
<p>
    While creating the print job all of the <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> are parsed from the JSON and a job reference id is
    generated to uniquely identify the created job.
</p>
<p>
    Once the print job is started, the <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> are passed to the <a href="processors.html">processors</a>. The
    processors work with the <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> in order to generate the maps, tables, legends, etc... that are required
    by the <a href="outputformats.html">output format</a> (Jasper template).
</p>
<p>
    Once the <a href="processors.html">processors</a> have all completed execution all of the values are passed to the <a
        href="outputformats.html">output format</a> which uses that information to generate the report. In theory an <a href="outputformats.html">output
    format</a> could be anything that generates a report. However the current version uses the
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports Library</a> for its outputs and several of the
    processors are Jasper Reports focuses.
    Because of this the documentation will assume that the output format is always based on
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="outputformats.html">output format</a> will generate a report and store it in some way for later retrieval. At this point the
    status request would return a response indicating that the print job has completed.
