    This page lists all the <em>processors </em> available in the Mapfish Print distribution. The documentation consists of several parts:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Description</b>: the full description for each processor can be found by expanding one of the list elements.</li>
    <li><b>Configuration</b>: the configuration options are also listed when a processor element is expanded. A configuration option is a value
        that can be set on the processor in the configuration yaml file. These options are consistent across all print jobs because they
        are not provided by the client.
    </li>
    <li><b>Input</b>: the required input values of the processor are listed when the processor element is in expanded form. Input values are
        either <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> or the output values of other processors.
    </li>
    <li><b>Output</b>: the output values of the processors are also listed when a processor element is expanded. As the name implies, the output
        values are the data the processor produces and is the input of other processors or the input parameters of the outputFormat
        template.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A processor's main responsibility is to take the <a
        href="attributes.html">attributes</a> for the print job and producing the parameters required by the <a href="outputformats.html">
    output format</a> to produce the report.
</p>
<p>
    While many processors are responsible for directly producing the parameters required by the <a href="outputformats.html">output format</a>,
    some processors be considered <em>support</em> processors. A support processor is a processor that in some way prepares attributes for
    the </em>primary</em> processors. For example, there are processors that can add layers to the map so that all maps will have the
    layers (reducing the data the client needs to send.) Another example are several processors which configure how http requests are make
    (add cookies, headers, remap URLs, etc...)
</p>
<p>
    A processor usually has inputs and outputs, in the simple case an input is one of the attributes and the outputs all map to parameters
    in the Jasper template. Each input and output have default names and often these are sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    However consider the case where a report had two maps (or legends or....). In this case the default input and output parameter names
    are not sufficient because the input attributes need to be mapped to the correct processor and the output values need to be mapped to
    the correct parameters in the templates. In order to account for this case, processors have the configuration options: <code>inputMapper</code> and
    <code>outputMapper</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <code>inputMapper</code> and <code>outputMapper</code> configuration parameters can be configured as follows:
<div class="highlight-yaml"><div class="highlight"><pre>
- !createMap
    inputMapper: {attributeName: defaultInputParamName}
    outputMapper: {defaultOutputName: templateParamName}</pre></div></div>

Or if the there are multiple mappings that need to be made :
<div class="highlight-yaml"><div class="highlight"><pre>
- processorName
    inputMapper : {
      attributeName1 : inputName1
      attributeName2 : inputName2
    }</pre></div></div>
