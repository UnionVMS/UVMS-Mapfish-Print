        This authentication manager is not really production quality.  It will work if you don't have complex
        needs but it is recommended to use ldap or database based authentication providers, etc..
        See http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#ns-config for some
        help
